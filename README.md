**Octopus Project**
===================

**Octopus** is a unified SQL query interface for polyglot persistency system. Octopus is designed by SK Telecom and Bitnine.
It is currently under implementation.

Octopus will provide Ansi-SQL interface over heterogeneous databases including Hadoop systems, RDBMS and many NoSQL systems.
It will also provide authentication and authorization features similar to regular database systems.

Our goal is to make users to feel like using a single database system, which actually consists of several database systems.

**Features**
============

1. Subset of ANSI-SQL
2. Queries on multiple databases including Spark-SQL and Oracle, etc.
3. SQL-based authorization
4. User authentication
5. Unified schema view over various kinds of databases
